rrelayer is an opensource powerful, high-performance blockchain transaction relay service built in Rust, designed for seamless 
integration with any EVM-compatible network. This tool transforms complex blockchain interactions into simple REST API calls, 
eliminating the need for applications to manage wallets, gas optimization, transaction queuing, or nonce management. For 
enterprise needs, rrelayer provides advanced wallet infrastructure with support for multiple secure signing providers 
including AWS KMS hardware security modules, Turnkey self-custody solutions, Privy-managed wallets, AWS Secrets Manager, 
GCP Secret Manager, and raw mnemonic development setups. It's highly scalable and production-ready, enabling you to build 
robust Web3 applications with enterprise-grade reliability and focus exclusively on your business logic. rrelayer out of the 
box gives you transaction relay, message signing, automated gas management, and real-time monitoring through intuitive APIs.
