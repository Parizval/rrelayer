Note rrelayer is brand new and actively under development, things will change and bugs will exist - if you find any bugs or have any
feature requests please open an issue on [github](https://github.com/joshstevens19/rrelayer/issues).

rrelayer is an opensource powerful, high-performance blockchain transaction relay service built in Rust,
designed for seamless integration with any EVM-compatible network. This tool transforms complex
blockchain interactions into simple REST API calls, eliminating the need for applications to
manage wallets, gas optimization, transaction queuing, or nonce management. For enterprise
needs, rrelayer provides advanced wallet infrastructure with support for multiple
secure signing providers including AWS KMS hardware security modules, Turnkey self-custody
solutions, Privy-managed wallets, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, and raw mnemonic
development setups. It's highly scalable and production-ready, enabling you to build robust
Web3 applications with enterprise-grade reliability and focus exclusively on your business
logic. rrelayer out of the box gives you transaction relay, message signing, automated
gas management, and real-time monitoring through intuitive APIs.

## SDKs

- Node - https://rrelayer.xyz/integration/sdk/installation/node
- Rust - https://rrelayer.xyz/integration/sdk/installation/rust

## What networks do you support?

rrelayer supports any EVM chain out of the box. If you have a custom chain, you can easily add support for it by
adding the chain's RPC URL to the YAML configuration file and defining the chain ID. No code changes are required.

## Building

### Requirements

- Rust (latest stable)

### Locally

To build locally you can just run `cargo build` in the root of the project. This will build everything for you as this is a workspace.

**Note:** The first build may take longer.

Subsequent builds use smart caching and will only rebuild components that have changed.

### Prod

To build for prod you can run `make prod_build` this will build everything for you and optimise it for production.

## Formatting

you can run `cargo fmt` to format the code, rules have been mapped in the `rustfmt.toml` file.

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute to rrelayer, feel free to look over the issues or open a new one if you have
any new ideas or bugs you have found.

### Playing around with the CLI locally

You can use the `make` commands to run the CLI commands locally, this is useful for testing and developing.
These are located in the `cli` folder > `Makefile`. It uses `CURDIR` to resolve the paths for you, so they should work
out of the box.

## Release

To release a new rrelayer:

1. Checkout `release/x.x.x` branch depending on the next version number
2. Push the branch to GitHub which will queue a build on the CI
3. Once build is successful, a PR will be automatically created with updated changelog and version
4. Review and merge the auto-generated PR - this will auto-deploy the release with binaries built from the release branch
