# rrelayer

## The last core feature to see how much scope gets added:
- cron job to hit a contract call with parameters every n minutes
- send tx on event firing using rindexer

## TODO List

- Finish documentation - in-progress
- Internal documentation in the README.MD throughout
- AI write go and python SDK
- Publish NPM packages for TS package + Go + Python + Rust

## BUG

- Testing loading up ALL supported gas providers so it works
- Testing handling custom gas with http call
- rrelayer auth without being in project
- look at signers in the networks

# AFTER

- Create CI to run E2E tests
- Create CI to build CLI binary (copy from rindexer)
