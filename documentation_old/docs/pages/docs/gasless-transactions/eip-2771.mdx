# ERC-2771 - Secure Protocol for Native Meta Transactions

[ERC-2711](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771) is a standard for secure meta transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
It defines a way for users to delegate the signing of their transactions to a third-party service, called a meta transaction relayer.
The relayer then submits the transaction on behalf of the user, paying the gas fee.

This standard is designed to reduce the cost of gas fees for users, as they no longer need to pay the gas fee to sign their own transactions.
Additionally, it can improve the user experience by making it easier for users to submit transactions.

The scope of helping you build a ERC-2771 on your smart contract is out of scope here but there is plenty of documents which explain how you can do it

We explain on the next page other custom ways you can power their smart contracts with meta transactions.
