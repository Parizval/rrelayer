# Introduction

rrelayer exposes an fully fledged REST API to manage everything. This API is used in the UI dashboard to do admin actions but also allows
you to hit these endpoints directly if you ever needed to script something.

We have 4 main areas of the API:

- Network API: This is used to manage the networks that the relayer is connected to. This includes adding new networks, removing networks, and updating networks.
- Relay API: Thie is used to manage all the relayer related settings. This includes adding new relayers, removing relayers, updating relayers, adding API keys and more.
- Transaction API: This is used to manage all the transactions that the relayer is processing. This includes sending new transactions, getting transactions, updating transactions and more.
- Gas API: This is used to get the current gas prices for the network and expose any other gas related stuff.

Note this will cover the REST endpoints but all these calls are abstracted away in the SDKs we support.
