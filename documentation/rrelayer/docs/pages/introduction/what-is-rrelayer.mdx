# What is rrelayer?

rrelayer is an open-source relayer built in Rust that enables gasless transactions, transaction migrations, L2 proof transactions, blob storage transactions, and general blockchain automation.

rrelayer provides a complete out-of-the-box solution for managing Ethereum transactions. It automatically handles gas price fluctuations, bumps transactions when needed, and ensures your transactions get confirmed on-chain.

## Architecture

### Server

The core Rust server handles transaction relaying, accepting transactions and adding them to a processing queue. It monitors network gas changes and includes safeguards for:

- Maximum spending limits
- Address allowlisting
- Transaction retry logic
- RESTful API for programmatic access

The server uses PostgreSQL for data persistence with in-memory caching for high-performance processing.

### SDKs

RRelayer ships with fully-featured SDKs for easy integration:

- **TypeScript** - Complete support for viem and ethers.js
- **Rust, Go, Python** - Coming soon (use direct API calls for now)
