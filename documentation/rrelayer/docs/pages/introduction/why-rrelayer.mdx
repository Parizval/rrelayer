# Why rrelayer?

## Why do we need rrelayer in general?

Managing blockchain transactions is essential for developers building Web3 applications, DeFi protocols, and enterprise blockchain integrations.
Building the necessary transaction infrastructure, however, presents significant challenges.
It is complex, time-consuming, and can divert focus from core business logic and application development.
As applications scale and require reliable transaction processing with gas optimization, nonce management, and multi-chain support, the need for robust, easily deployable transaction relay solutions grows.
While some transaction relay tools exist, most are proprietary SaaS solutions, so creating an opensource, self-hosted relayer provides critical infrastructure independence for the Web3 ecosystem.

## The Problems

Traditional transaction management requires developers to handle gas estimation, nonce tracking, transaction queuing, wallet security, and retry logic manually. This complexity can delay application development and introduce reliability issues, especially when scaling across multiple chains or handling high transaction volumes. Additionally, existing SaaS providers often impose rate limits, usage-based pricing, and vendor lock-in that can become prohibitively expensive as applications grow.

Effective transaction infrastructure should be simple to deploy and operate, requiring minimal configuration for basic relay needs, while providing enterprise-grade features for production applications. Modern Web3 applications require sophisticated transaction management including gas price optimization, automatic retry mechanisms, comprehensive monitoring, and support for advanced transaction types like EIP-4844 blobs.

The proven success of Rust-based blockchain tools like Foundry, Reth, and Alloy demonstrates significant performance advantages over existing solutions, which rrelayer leverages for maximum transaction throughput and reliability.

## Developer Experience

rrelayer dramatically enhances the developer experience by eliminating transaction management complexity entirely.
Its straightforward REST API allows developers to submit transactions with a single HTTP call, enabling them to focus entirely on application logic rather than blockchain infrastructure specifics.
The comprehensive SDK support for TypeScript, Rust, and direct API integration means developers can use familiar tools and patterns.
For advanced use cases, rrelayer provides enterprise-grade features like multiple wallet providers, gas optimization strategies, and comprehensive monitoring without requiring infrastructure expertise.

## Infrastructure Control

Self-hosting rrelayer provides complete control over transaction infrastructure, costs, and reliability.
Unlike SaaS providers that impose usage limits and escalating costs, rrelayer allows unlimited transaction volume at predictable infrastructure costs.
This control becomes critical for high-volume applications, enterprise deployments, and applications requiring custom gas strategies or specialized wallet configurations.
Being opensource and extensible means you can adapt rrelayer to specific requirements and maintain long-term infrastructure independence.

## Performance

Rust was chosen for developing rrelayer due to its exceptional performance and memory safety characteristics. Its zero-cost abstractions and efficient concurrency model enable rrelayer to handle thousands of concurrent transactions with minimal latency and resource usage. This makes rrelayer ideal for high-throughput applications, real-time trading systems, and enterprise-scale transaction processing where performance directly impacts user experience and operational costs.
