Important to know that `rrelayer` should always be hit from your backend server due to authentication / API keys,
if you expose it in the frontend, anyone can hit rrelayer and do actions.
If you are using `next.js` you can use the server side API, which you can read more [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes).

rrelayer has built-in framework integrations with [viem](/integration/sdk/framework-guides/typescript/viem) and [ethers](/integration/sdk/framework-guides/typescript/ethers);
this allows you to integrate with those frameworks in a few lines of code, most the time that is what you will want to do.

If you want to use all the features, you can use the direct SDK you can get started with that [here](/integration/sdk/create-client-authentication/node).
