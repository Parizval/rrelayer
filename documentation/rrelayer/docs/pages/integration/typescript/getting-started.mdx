# Getting started

You can get setup using rrelayer on your backend system really easily

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i rrelayer
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i rrelayer
```

```bash [bun]
bun i rrelayer
```

:::

Important to know that `rrelayer` should always be hit from your backend server due to authentication / API keys,
if you expose it in the frontend, anyone can hit rrelayer and do actions.
If you are using `next.js` you can use the server side API, which you can read more [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes).

Built in the rrelayer package you can:
- [Use viem to do the actions in a few lines of code](/integration/typescript/viem)
- [Use ethers to do the actions in a few lines of code](/integration/typescript/ethers)
- [Direct SDK](/integration/typescript/sdk)
