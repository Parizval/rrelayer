# Private Keys

You can use existing private keys if you wish, rrelayer will import them on startup and create relayers
for you automatically, if you got many networks, it creates a relayer for each pk on every network for you.

:::warning
NOTE USING PRIVATE KEYS ONLY MEANS IF YOU TRY TO CREATE A NEW RELAYER IT WILL THROW AN ERROR.
:::

## Usage

To enable private keys signing, you need to add its config in the YAML under the `private_keys` key:

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}"
  authentication_password: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}"
signing_provider: // [!code focus]
  private_keys: // [!code focus]
    - raw: "${PK_1}" // [!code focus]
    - raw: "${PK_2}" // [!code focus]
```

You can have as many PKs as you want and map them in the `.env` file.

:::info
You can call PK_1 or PK_2 anything it is just advising you to make sure you don't paste it clear text in the YAML
:::

## Using with another signing provider

As private keys only import and don't allow you to create new ones, you can use private key signers with any other
signing provider you wish.

Example below of having private key signers as well as aws secret manager.

:::info
Note you can config this with any signing provider aws secret manager is just an example.
:::

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider: // [!code focus]
  aws_secret_manager: // [!code focus]
    id: "testing-josh-relayer" // [!code focus]
    key: "seed" // [!code focus]
    region: "eu-west-1" // [!code focus]
  private_keys: // [!code focus]
    - raw: "${PK_1}" // [!code focus]
    - raw: "${PK_2}" // [!code focus]
```
