# Turnkey

Turnkey is a crypto infrastructure platform that provides secure key management and wallet-as-a-service solutions for developers building Web3 applications.
The platform focuses on enterprise-grade security and compliance while offering APIs that allow developers to integrate sophisticated
cryptographic operations without managing the underlying security infrastructure themselves.

:::info
This guide will just talk about how you config the signing provider and not go into depth of the setup on the Turnkey portal.
:::

:::warning
We advise you create a brand new wallet on Turnkey and do not allow anyone else to use it this is because rrelayer attaches IDs
to each new wallet created so it knows how to load the list and keep it in sync.
:::

## Usage

To enable Turnkey you need to add its `api_public_key`, `api_private_key`, `organization_id` and `wallet_id` in the YAML under the `turnkey` key:

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}"
  authentication_password: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}"
signing_provider: // [!code focus]
  turnkey:  // [!code focus]
    api_public_key: "${TURNKEY_PUBLIC_KEY}"  // [!code focus]
    api_private_key: "${TURNKEY_PRIVATE_KEY}"  // [!code focus]
    organization_id: "${TURNKEY_ORG_ID}"  // [!code focus]
    wallet_id: "{TURNKEY_WALLET_ID}"  // [!code focus]
```

You then need to add the turnkey credentials to the `.env`

```bash
TURNKEY_PUBLIC_KEY=YOUR_TURNKEY_PUBLIC_KEY
TURNKEY_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_TURNKEY_PRIVATE_KEY
TURNKEY_ORG_ID=YOUR_TURNKEY_ORG_ID
TURNKEY_WALLET_ID=YOUR_TURNKEY_WALLET_ID
```

:::info
You can call TURNKEY_PUBLIC_KEY, TURNKEY_PRIVATE_KEY, TURNKEY_ORG_ID and TURNKEY_WALLET_ID anything it is just advising you
to make sure you don't paste it clear text in the YAML
:::

You can get the turnkey credentials from the Privy developer dashboard.
