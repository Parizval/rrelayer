# Privy

Privy is a developer infrastructure platform that provides embedded wallet solutions and user authentication for Web3 applications.
It offers a suite of tools designed to simplify crypto onboarding by allowing users to create wallets using familiar authentication methods
like email, phone numbers, or social logins, without requiring them to manage seed phrases or private keys directly. Privy handles the
complex cryptographic operations behind the scenes while providing developers with APIs to integrate wallet functionality into their applications.

:::info
This guide will just talk about how you config the signing provider and not go into depth of the setup on the Privy portal.

:::warning
We advise you create a brand new app on Privy and do not allow anyone else to use it this is because rrelayer attaches IDs
to each new wallet created so it knows how to load the list and keep it in sync.

# Usage

To enable Privy you need to add its `app_id` and `app_secret` in the YAML under the `privy` key:

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}"
  authentication_password: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}"
signing_provider: // [!code focus]
  privy: // [!code focus]
    app_id: "${PRIVY_APP_ID}" // [!code focus]
    app_secret: "${PRIVY_APP_SECRET}" // [!code focus]
```

You then need to add the privy credentials to the `.env`

```bash
PRIVY_APP_ID=YOUR_PRIVY_APP_ID
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=YOUR_PRIVY_APP_SECRET
```

:::info
You can call PRIVY_APP_ID and PRIVY_APP_SECRET anything it is just advising you to make sure you don't paste it clear text in the YAML
:::

You can get the `app_id` and `app_secret` from the Privy developer dashboard.
