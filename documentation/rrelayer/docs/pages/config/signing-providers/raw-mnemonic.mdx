# Raw Mnemonic

You can just use a mnemonic you have already or a new one to run rrelayer.

:::warning
Production running of rrelayer we advise you to use a more secure signing provider.
:::

# Usage

To enable raw mnemonic you need to add its config in the YAML under the `mnemonic` key:

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}"
  authentication_password: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}"
signing_provider: // [!code focus]
  raw: // [!code focus]
    mnemonic: "${RAW_DANGEROUS_MNEMONIC}" // [!code focus]
```

You then need to add the RAW_DANGEROUS_MNEMONIC variables to the `.env`

```bash
RAW_DANGEROUS_MNEMONIC=YOUR_RAW_MNEMONIC
```

:::info
You can call RAW_DANGEROUS_MNEMONIC anything it is just advising you to make sure you don't paste it clear text in the YAML
