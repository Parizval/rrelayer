# Networks

rrelayer supports any EVM chain out the box. You can config this really easily. Alongside it allows some additional nice features
which we talk about a little later.

## Fields

### name

This is the name of the network it can be anything its YOUR name of it

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum" // [!code focus]
```

### chain_id

This is the chain id for the network

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111 // [!code focus]
```

### provider_urls

This is rpc urls for your network which rrelayer will use to send transactions and also monitor transactions.
It can accept an array of providers and will randomly load balance through them if you put more then 1.

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls: // [!code focus]
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co" // [!code focus]
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io"
```

### block_explorer_url - optional

This is the block explorer url - it will come back in network info but is not required

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls:
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io" // [!code focus]
```

Lets move on to the more advanced things you can config in the network config.

### confirmations - optional default 12

This is how many confirmations it will wait to mark it as CONFIRMED this will still mark it as MINED asap and normally
applications consider it done after that

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls:
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io"
  confirmations: 2 // [!code focus]
```

### enable_sending_blobs - optional

When blobs are enabled it does additional RPC lookups for the blob gas oracles so you can disable it by setting this to false

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks: // [!code focus]
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls:
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io"
  confirmations: 12
  enable_sending_blobs: false // [!code focus]
```
