# API keys - optional

The root authentication for rrelayer is basic auth but this gives admin access to anyone with that and thats not ideal if you
wish to just have a single relayer used on a system which can just send and sign transactions. This is where API keys come in
you can assign API keys to a relayer and with that API key systems can send, sign and read information about just that relayer.
Note [permissions](/config/networks/permissions) will inherit on everything. This API key cannot do any write actions to the relayer
itself it can only read information about the relayer and do transactions and signing with it.

:::info
Note here you have to expose `API_KEY_1`, `API_KEY_2` and `API_KEY_3` in the `.env.`
:::

:::info
API keys are generated by YOU it's just an `.env` injection you're putting in here they can be called/be anything, you can use
`rrelayer auth gen-api-key` which will generate you one in your terminal for you to then map in your `rrelayer.yaml`.
