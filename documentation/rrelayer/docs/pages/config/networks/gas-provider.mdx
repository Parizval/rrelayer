# Gas Provider

Every transaction has a gas price which you are willing to pay, and this is computed by how active the
chain is at a given time. A few gas price providers exist, but all require signup; we do recommend
that you use a provider over the fallback as it will be more aligned to the prices.

## Infura

You can go to infura docs to see what chains they support https://docs.metamask.io/services/get-started/endpoints#gas-api.
You can sign up to the developer dashboard https://developer.metamask.io/register and get a free API key.
A note as we hit the gas price in a cron it only hits it every few seconds, so a free key tends to work fine,
the free rate limit gives you 2k credits a second and 6 million credits a day, which is plenty for this.

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}"
  authentication_password: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}"
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks:
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls:
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io"

  infura: // [!code focus]
    api_key: "${INFURA_API_KEY}" // [!code focus]
    secret: "${INFURA_SECRET_KEY}" // [!code focus]
```

## Tenderly

You can go to tenderly docs to see what chains they support https://docs.tenderly.co/supported-networks which is most EVM chains.
You can sign up to the developer dashboard https://dashboard.tenderly.co/ and get a free API key.
A note as we hit the gas price in a cron it only hits it every few seconds, so a free key tends to work fine.

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}"
  authentication_password: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}"
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks:
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls:
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io"
  gas_provider: "TENDERLY" // [!code focus]
gas_providers: // [!code focus]
  tenderly: // [!code focus]
    api_key: "${TENDERLY_API_KEY}" // [!code focus]
```

## Custom

You can implement your own custom gas fee estimator by providing an API endpoint that returns gas price estimates.
This allows you to integrate with any gas price service or build your own gas estimation logic.

The custom gas provider expects your endpoint to return gas estimates in a specific JSON format with
four speed tiers: `slow`, `medium`, `fast`, and `superFast`. Each tier should include suggested gas prices and optional wait time estimates.

### Expected API Response Format

Your custom endpoint should return a JSON response with this structure:

```json
{
  "slow": {
    "suggestedMaxPriorityFeePerGas": "0.1",
    "suggestedMaxFeePerGas": "2.5",
    "minWaitTimeEstimate": 180,
    "maxWaitTimeEstimate": 300
  },
  "medium": {
    "suggestedMaxPriorityFeePerGas": "0.5",
    "suggestedMaxFeePerGas": "4.0",
    "minWaitTimeEstimate": 60,
    "maxWaitTimeEstimate": 120
  },
  "fast": {
    "suggestedMaxPriorityFeePerGas": "1.0",
    "suggestedMaxFeePerGas": "6.0",
    "minWaitTimeEstimate": 15,
    "maxWaitTimeEstimate": 60
  },
  "superFast": {
    "suggestedMaxPriorityFeePerGas": "2.0",
    "suggestedMaxFeePerGas": "10.0",
    "minWaitTimeEstimate": 5,
    "maxWaitTimeEstimate": 15
  }
}
```

Gas prices should be provided as strings in Gwei. Wait time estimates are optional and should be in seconds.

```yaml [rrelayer.yaml]
name: first-rrelayer
description: "my first rrelayer"
api_config:
  port: 3000
  authentication_username: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}"
  authentication_password: "${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}"
signing_provider:
  aws_kms:
    region: "eu-west-1"
networks:
- name: "sepolia_ethereum"
  chain_id: 11155111
  provider_urls:
  - "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
  block_explorer_url: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io"
  gas_provider: "CUSTOM" // [!code focus]
gas_providers: // [!code focus]
  custom: // [!code focus]
    endpoint: "https://api.example.com/gas-estimates" // [!code focus]
    supported_chains: [1, 11155111, 137] // [!code focus]
    auth_header: "${CUSTOM_GAS_API_AUTH_HEADER}" // [!code focus]
```

### Configuration Options

- **`endpoint`**: The base URL of your gas estimation API. The relayer will append the chain ID to this URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com/gas-estimates/1` for Ethereum mainnet)
- **`supported_chains`**: Array of chain IDs that your custom gas provider supports
- **`auth_header`** *(optional)*: Authorization header value to include in requests to your API
