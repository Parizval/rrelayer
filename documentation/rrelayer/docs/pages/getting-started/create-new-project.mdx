# Create New Project - Standard Mode

:::info
Make sure you have the CLI installed before starting a new project.
You can find the installation instructions [here](/getting-started/installation).
:::

We advise anyone using rindexer to install docker which makes running locally with postgres storage a lot easier.
If you not got docker you can install it [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## 1. Create a new project

This will walk you through setting up your project by asking you a series of questions in the terminal.

```bash [rust]
rrelayer new
```

### Example New

```bash
Initializing new rindexer project...

Enter project name: MyFirstRelayer
Enter project description (skip by pressing Enter): My first rrelayer project
Do you want Docker support out of the box (will make it easy to run)? [Y/n]: Y

Project 'MyFirstRelayer' initialized successfully! note we advise to not use the RAW_DANGEROUS_MNEMONIC in production and use one of the secure key management signing keys. Alongside replace RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME and RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD in the .env
```

Once completed a new boilerplate project will be created in the current directory. You can navigate to the project directory and start building your project.
The boilerplate project is configured with sepolia ethereum testnet configured to be able to easily start it up.

## 2. Environment Variables

On creation, it will generate you a `.env` with some values it to make it easy to run by default it generates you signing provider raw which
is not the securest to run as the seed is in the `env`, but rrelayer offers many signing key provider which you can find out more [here](../todo).

The `.env` file will look something like this:

```bash
RAW_DANGEROUS_MNEMONIC="RANDOM SEED PHRASE"
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:rrelayer@localhost:5441/postgres # will say FILL_IN if you did not pick docker support out the box
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=rrelayer # will only be here if you picked docker support out the box
RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME=your_username
RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### RAW_DANGEROUS_MNEMONIC

This is just a seed phrase in the env file as said you can use many more secure key providers but we do this to be easy to just run off the bat,
relayer offers many signing key provider which you can find out more [here](../todo).

### DATABASE_URL

For ease of running locally we suggest you enable docker support on the rrelayer project, if you did not
enable docker support you will need to provide a postgres database information in the `.env` file
which has been generated for you.

`sslmode=require` is supported as well just include it in the connection string.

### POSTGRES_PASSWORD - docker only

This is injected into the `.env` for your if you selected `yes` to the `Postgres Docker Support Out The Box?` question.
This is used for the docker to create a postgres database for you locally. You do not need this if you have your own postgres database or
on deployed environments. It is purely for local development.

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
```

### RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME

rrelayer uses basic auth to allow you to config who can hit the rrelayer API, so this is the username used, you should replace it
with one which is more secure before you deploy this to production. Note if anyone gets these details, they can hit your relayers.

### RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD

rrelayer uses basic auth to allow you to config who can hit the rrelayer API, so this is the password used, you should replace it
with one which is more secure before you deploy this to production. Note if anyone gets these details, they can hit your relayers.

### Other Environment Variables

Every part of the `rrelayer.yaml` file can be overridden by an environment variable.
The syntax for this in the `rrelayer.yaml` is `${ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}` example `${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}`. This can be used in ANY field in the YAML file.
Read more about the environment variables in the [yaml configuration documentation](/docs/start-building/yaml-config#environment-variables).

## 3. Config your `rrelayer.yaml` file

Generating a rrelayer project will generate a `rrelayer.yaml` file for you. This is where you will configure your project.
You can read all about the rrelayer.yaml settings in the [yaml configuration documentation](/config).

It will generate you an boilerplate project which is configured to sepolia ethereum network.

:::warning
The boilerplate template uses no gas price provider which means its estimating the gas prices from the last 20 blocks as the fallback.
To get more exact prices we recommend you setting up one of the supported gas price providers which you can find more info on [here](/gas-providers).
:::

```yaml
name: first-rrelayer
description: 'my first rrelayer'
api_config:
  port: 8000
  authentication_username: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_USERNAME}
  authentication_password: ${RRELAYER_AUTH_PASSWORD}
signing_provider:
  raw:
    mnemonic: ${RAW_DANGEROUS_MNEMONIC}
networks:
  - name: sepolia_ethereum
    chain_id: 11155111
    provider_urls:
      - https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co
    block_explorer_url: https://sepolia.etherscan.io
```

## 4. Start the project

:::info
rrelayer starts your postgres docker compose file up for you automatically if the DATABASE_URL can not connect to the database and docker-compose.yml is present in the parent directory.
You will need to make sure you have docker running on your machine before starting the project. If you have not got docker you can install it [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
You can also run docker manually by using `docker compose up -d`.
:::

to run make sure your in your rrelayer project and then run:

rrelayer start

The boilerplate template uses a free rpc node which may get rate limited. We recommend using a paid node for production.

That is it your rrelayer is running and you can start using it straight away. Might be good to explore the
