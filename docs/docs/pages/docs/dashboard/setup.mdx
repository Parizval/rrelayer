# Setup

It is best to install the repo from source, the main reason is this is really easy to fetch the latest changes.

## Installing

:::code-group

```bash [http]
git clone https://github.com/joshstevens19/rrelayerr.git
```

```bash [ssh]
git clone git@github.com:joshstevens19/rrelayerr.git
```

:::

Once installed you can cd into the folder `rrelayerr_dashboard_ui`

:::code-group

```bash [http]
git clone https://github.com/joshstevens19/rrelayerr.git
cd ./rrelayerr_dashboard_ui
```

```bash [ssh]
git clone git@github.com:joshstevens19/rrelayerr.git
cd ./rrelayerr_dashboard_ui
```

:::

Once within the folder install the node modules

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i
```

```bash [bun]
bun i
```

:::

Now you need to point the dashboard to the correct API by default it look for the local server `localhost:8000`, you can do this by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project and adding the following line

```bash
RRELAYERR_API=https://mydeployedserver.io
```

## Running

To run the dashboard you can use the following command

```bash
npm run start
```

This will expose the dashboard on https://localhost:3000

## Building

To build the dashboard you can use the following command

```bash
npm run build
```
