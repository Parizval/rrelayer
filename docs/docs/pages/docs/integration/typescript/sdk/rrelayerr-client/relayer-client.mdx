## Create relayer client

If you want to send transactions or do anything related to a relayer you must start a relayer client

:::code-group

```ts [without providerUrl]
import { rrelayerClient } from './config';

const client = await rrelayerClient.createRelayerClient({
  relayerId: 'b12be8a1-7e95-4a5c-b46a-fbd124ee5771',
  apiKey: 'INSERT_API_KEY',
});
```

```ts [with providerUrl]
import { rrelayerClient } from './config';

const client = await rrelayerClient.createRelayerClient({
  // you can pass in a dedicated provider url if you want to use
  // the full ethereum provider aka reads and writes
  // if you dont pass this in it fetch the provider url from
  // rrelayer server
  providerUrl: 'NODE_URL',
  relayerId: 'b12be8a1-7e95-4a5c-b46a-fbd124ee5771',
  apiKey: 'INSERT_API_KEY',
});
```

```ts [config]
import { createRRelayerrClient } from 'rrelayer-ts';

export const rrelayerClient = createRRelayerrClient({
  // This is where the rrelayer server is hosted
  serverUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000',
  // This is your API secret access key you can have many
  // of these but you generate them within the server itself
  // This is a secret for a reason do not expose it on a client
  apiSecretAccessKey: 'INSERT_API_SECRET',
});
```

```ts [response]
type response = RelayerClient;
```
