# rrelayerr client

rrelayerr supports full typescript integration. A note here is the call to the rrelayerr server must pass in a API secret, this secret must never be leaked client side. If you want to do actions on your client with the relayer
you must build a nextJS server call and call it server side or if you using another language you must have a proxy between it. If you leak this API secret that means anyone can do anything with your relayer.

## Creating a rrelayerr client

The rrelayerr client is the main entry point for interacting with the rrelayerr server. You can create a client by calling the `createRRelayerrClient` function and passing in the server url and the api secret access key.

```ts
import { createRRelayerrClient } from 'rrelayerr-ts';

const rrelayerrClient = createRRelayerrClient({
  // This is where the rrelayerr server is hosted
  serverUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000',
  // This is your API secret access key you can have many
  // of these but you generate them within the server itself
  // This is a secret for a reason do not expose it on a client
  apiSecretAccessKey: 'INSERT_API_SECRET',
});
```
