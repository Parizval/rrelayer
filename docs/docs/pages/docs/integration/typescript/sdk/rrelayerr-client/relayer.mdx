);
```

```ts [config]
import { createRRelayerrClient } from 'rrelayer-ts';

export const rrelayerClient = createRRelayerrClient({
  // This is where the rrelayer server is hosted
  serverUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000',
  // This is your API secret access key you can have many
  // of these but you generate them within the server itself
  // This is a secret for a reason do not expose it on a client
  apiSecretAccessKey: 'INSERT_API_SECRET',
});
```

```ts [response]
interface Relayer {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  chainId: number;
  address: Address;
  maxGasPrice?: number;
  paused: boolean;
  allowlistedOnly: boolean;
  eip1559Enabled: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
}

type response = Relayer | null;
```

### Get all relayers

:::code-group

```ts [get all]
import { rrelayerClient } from './config';

const relayers = await rrelayerClient.relayer.getAll();
```

```ts [get all for chain]
import { rrelayerClient } from './config';

const relayers = await rrelayerClient.relayer.getAll(1);
```

```ts [config]
import { createRRelayerrClient } from 'rrelayer-ts';

export const rrelayerClient = createRRelayerrClient({
  // This is where the rrelayer server is hosted

  id: string;
  address: string;
}

type response = CreateRelayerResult;
```
