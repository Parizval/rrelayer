# rrelayer relayer client

This client allows you to do stuff with the relayer itself like sign and send transactions (and more).

## Creating an client

```ts
import { createRRelayerClient } from 'rrelayer-ts';

const rrelayerClient = createRRelayerClient({
  // This is where the rrelayer server is hosted
  serverUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000',
  // This is your API secret access key you can have many
  // of these but you generate them within the server itself
  // This is a secret for a reason do not expose it on a client
  apiSecretAccessKey: 'INSERT_API_SECRET',
});

const client = await rrelayerClient.createRelayerClient({
  relayerId: 'b12be8a1-7e95-4a5c-b46a-fbd124ee5771',
  apiKey: 'INSERT_API_KEY',
});
```
