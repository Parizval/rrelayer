# Getting started

rrelayer supports full typescript integration. A note here is the call to the rrelayer server must pass in a API secret, this secret must never be leaked client side. If you want to do actions on your client with the relayer
you must build a nextJS server call and call it server side or if you using another language you must have a proxy between it. If you leak this API secret that means anyone can do anything with your relayer.

## Installation

First you should install the rrelayer-ts package

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i rrelayer-ts
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i rrelayer-ts
```

```bash [bun]
bun i rrelayer-ts
```

## Creating a rrelayer client

The rrelayer client is the main entry point for interacting with the rrelayer server. You can create a client by calling the `createRRelayerrClient` function and passing in the server url and the api secret access key.

```ts
import { createRRelayerrClient } from 'rrelayer-ts';

const client = createRRelayerrClient({
  // This is where the rrelayer server is hosted
  serverUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000',
  // This is your API secret access key you can have many
  // of these but you generate them within the server itself
  apiSecretAccessKey: 'INSERT_API_SECRET',
});
```

## Creating a rrelayer relayer client

The rrelayer client exposes ways for you to create an relayer client which exposes a ethereum provider you can use with `viem` or `ethers`.

```ts
import { createRRelayerrClient } from 'rrelayer-ts';

const client = createRRelayerrClient({
  // This is where the rrelayer server is hosted
  serverUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000',
  // This is your API secret access key you can have many
  // of these but you generate them within the server itself
  apiSecretAccessKey: 'INSERT_API_SECRET',
});

const relayer = await client.createRelayerClient({
  // The relayer ID you want to connect to
  relayerId: 'b12be8a1-7e95-4a5c-b46a-fbd124ee5771',
  // The api key for that relayer ID
  apiKey: 'API_KEY',
});
```

We talk more about the clients indepth functions within the [sdk](/docs/integration/typescript/sdk/rrelayer-client) section.

Now you know how to create a rrelayer client and a rrelayer relayer client lets look how you would integrate this with `viem` or `ethers`. We will start with `viem`.
