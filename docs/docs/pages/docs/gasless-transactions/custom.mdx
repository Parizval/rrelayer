# Custom gasless experience

If you are building the contracts you really can do what you want here and their is many approaches.

One way which is used in Lens is EIP-712 style signatures allowing the user to sign and then anyone to send that signature.
Lens also built their own profile manager which allowed permisson for the EOA/Contract to call the contract on behalf of the user.

Again the possibilities are endless here and there is plenty of docs around to explain how you could empower this. It is out of scope for rrelayerr to offer those guides for now.
