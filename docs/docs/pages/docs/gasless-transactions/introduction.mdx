# Gasless transactions

In every EVM network you have a native token which is the token used to pay for gas which in turn is paying someone to mine and put your transaction in a block.
To interact with the network you need to pay gas, but what if you don't have any gas? You can't do anything, you can't even send a transaction to someone to ask for gas.
This becomes a huge problem when you onboard a new user to the network, now they have to go to crypto exchange and buy some native token to pay for gas,
and they have to do this before they can do anything on your app. You can just see from reading that how most users would just give up then as buying the native token can take time and be a hassle.
rrelayerr gives you the infrastructure to solve this issue.

## How it works?

So a user tends to send the transaction directly to the blockchain via a JSONRPC call which in turn will add it to the mempool and then a miner will pick it up and put it in a block.
With a relayer the flows are slightly different, the user sends the transaction to the rrelayer, the rrelayer then sends the transaction to the blockchain and pays for the gas.
The relayer then makes sure the transaction being supported has the correct gas prices and gets the transaction over the line.

## Support on users byhalf or just submit transactions?

This is an important thing to consider their are two ways a person may be wanting to use a relayer.

1. You just want to submit a transaction and anyone can call it or the relayer address can call it only. Lets imagine you got some state you want to push back to Ethereum,
   you can just call the relayer and it will submit the transaction its not about the address itself its just something which needs actioning. Also if you need to do a migration script
   and migration a ton of state from a contract you could allowlist the relayer address and fire it.
2. You want the user to do the action but the relayer paying the gas for them to do it. We focus more on this point below so we can be sure we all understand.

## How does the relayer pay for the gas on the users behalf then?

So this is the bit more complicated bit, this does not work by default it depends how the smart contracts are designed.
A lot of smart contracts have thought about this and have a way to support gasless transactions.
There are a many ways to do this but the most common is to use EIP-2771 or EIP-721 style signatures to approve allowance for a relayer to pay for the gas on the users behalf.
In Lens for example they built a full profile manager service so you could add any EOA or contract and it could control the account and do actions for the profile again enabling gasless transactions.
Just note here there are many ways to do this and it depends on the smart contract you are interacting with or the smart contract you are building.

We will talk about them on the next page starting with EIP-2771.
