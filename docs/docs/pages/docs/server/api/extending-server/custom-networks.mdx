# Custom networks

rrelayer has some integrations with infura for example which only support an array of networks but rrelayer itself can support any evm network. If it does not have a gas provider supported by it then it use the fallback gas provider
which computes the gas price based on the last 10 blocks. We advise if you are building a network which is not in the list of supported gas estimators to write your own which we talk about in custom gas estimators or do a PR to
rrelayer to add support for your network.
